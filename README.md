# Speech Recognition and Displaying Colors


This code demonstrates how to use the SpeechRecognition API and display colors on a web page. The handleResult function is defined in a separate file called "handlers.js", while the colorsByLength and isDark functions are defined in a file called "colors.js".

The displayColors function takes an array of colors and returns a string of HTML code to display the colors as spans with the corresponding background colors.

The start function checks if the browser supports the SpeechRecognition API, and if so, creates a new SpeechRecognition object and starts listening for speech input. When the API detects speech, it calls the handleResult function to process the input.

Finally, the displayColors function is called to display the colors on the web page, and the start function is called to start listening for speech input.

## Usage
To use this code, simply include the relevant script files in your HTML document and call the start function. You may also need to modify the HTML and CSS to fit your specific needs.

Note that the SpeechRecognition API is not supported in all browsers, so it is important to check if it is available before using it.
